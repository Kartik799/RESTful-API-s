# RESTful-API-s
This project is a simple RESTful web application built using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. It implements full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing user posts.  Each post includes a unique ID, username, and content. The application uses server-side rendering with EJS templates and handles form submissions through Express.
